## Implementation details
## Fetching Data from API
This extension fetches exchange rate data from the Currency Beacon API (https://currencybeacon.com/). It uses the `/convert` endpoint to perform currency conversion based on the selected currencies and the amount entered by the user.

The API request is constructed with the following parameters:
- `from`: The currency code to convert from.
- `to`: The currency code to convert to.
- `amount`: The amount to convert.
- `api_key`: API key for authentication.

Example API request:
```
https://api.currencybeacon.com/v1/convert?from=EUR&to=USD&amount=100&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Upon receiving the response from the API, the extension displays the converted amount on the page.
